# The_Purple_Order

## This game is in development

For the moment I've done :

  Export #1
    *Creating the main menu (only the button quit and new game works)
    *Working a little in tileset and element of the game maps
    *I worked on the player and customization of the player
    *When we start a new game, we access to the menu of player creation, and we can create our own customized character
